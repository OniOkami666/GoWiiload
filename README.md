# Important
Please note that this go package is still under construction and that it is very VERY buggy and messy right now.  I am only releasing this because I am very tired to test right now.  If you want to contribute, fork this repo and dick around with it.  Be sure to make a PR if you want me to add those changes.

One more thing to note is that all the functions in the script are intertwined meaning they are working together to form this app.  I know it was a bad choice making it as a package but maybe I'll clean it up later.
